# RAW renderer

The RAW renderer is used for testing and as a basis for building more elegant renderers from. All elements defined in the `framework/elements/*.ts` typescript package have associated `.njk` files in this RAW folder. If a service doesn't require an element type then it's renderer doesn't need to implement a `.njk` file for that element type.
